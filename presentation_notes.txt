Code to go over:
- My HTML code is modified from online templates (MIT License)
- How filtering works: setting a filter updates the filtered blog post frame, but also adds the filter to the previous/next button url parameters
- User login: using the built in Django user functionality for simplicity
- Getting errors to pop up in the forms through the clean method

Demo:
- Login/logout
- view blog post
- comment on blog post
- delete comment
- create blog post
- delete blog post
- filter
- change page
